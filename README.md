## What does it do?
**`code-input`** lets you **turn any ordinary JavaScript syntax-highlighting theme and program into customisable syntax-highlighted textareas** using an HTML custom element. It uses vanilla CSS to superimpose a `textarea` on a `pre code` block, then handles indentations, scrolling and fixes any resulting bugs with JavaScript. To see how it works behind the scenes (not how to use this library), please see [this CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-textarea-that-supports-syntax-highlighted-code/ "Creating an Editable Textarea That Supports Syntax-Highlighted Code") I wrote.

## What are the advantages of using code-input, and what can it be used for?
Unlike other front-end code-editor projects, the simplicity of how `code-input` works means it is **highly customisable**. As it is not a full-featured editor, you can **choose what features you want it to include, and use your favourite syntax-highlighting algorithms and themes**.

The `<code-input>` element works like a `<textarea>` and therefore **works in HTML5 forms and supports using the `name`, `value` and `placeholder` attributes, events like `onchange`, form resets, to name a few...** [(Demo)](https://codepen.io/WebCoder49/details/JjmqjZv)

`code-input` has also accumulated many **features in optional [plugins](./plugins/README.md)** from open-source contributions, allowing you to choose any features you want. If a feature you want is not present, [please open an issue / contribute it!](#contributing)

## üöÄ Getting Started With `code-input` (in 4 simple steps)

## [`code-input` also supports TypeScript (click)](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input-for-typescript)

**You can follow the instructions below, or use the starter code available [here for highlight.js](https://codepen.io/WebCoder49/pen/vYMpMoJ?editors=1100) and [here for Prism.js](https://codepen.io/WebCoder49/pen/ExzNRyb?editors=1100).**

`code-input` is designed to be **both easy to use and customisable**. Here's how to use it to create syntax-highlighted textareas: 

### 1. Import `code-input`
- **First, import your favourite syntax-highlighter's JS and CSS theme files** to turn editable. 
- Then, import the CSS and JS files of `code-input` from a downloaded release or a CDN. The non-minified files are useful for using during development.

```html
<!--In the <head>-->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/code-input.min.css">
```
</details>
<details>

From JSDelivr CDN (click)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/WebCoder49/code-input@2.3/code-input.min.css">
```
</details>

### 2. Creating a template
The next step is to set up a `template` to link `code-input` to your syntax-highlighter. If you're using Prism.js or highlight.js, you can use the built-in template, or you can create your own otherwise. In these examples, I am registering the template as `"syntax-highlighted"`, but you can use any template name as long as you are consistent.

- *Highlight.js:*
  ```js
  codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", codeInput.templates.hljs(hljs, [] /* Array of plugins (see below) */));
  ```

- *Prism.js:*
  ```js
  codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", codeInput.templates.prism(Prism, [] /* Array of plugins (see below) */));
  ```

- *Custom:*
  ```js
  codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", new codeInput.Template(
    function(result_element) { /* Highlight function - with `pre code` code element */
      /* Highlight code in result_element - code is already escaped so it doesn't become HTML */
    },

    true, /* Optional - Is the `pre` element styled as well as the `code` element?
           * Changing this to false uses the code element as the scrollable one rather
           * than the pre element */
          
    true, /* Optional - This is used for editing code - setting this to true sets the `code`
           * element's class to `language-<the code-input's lang attribute>` */

    false /* Optional - Setting this to true passes the `<code-input>` element as a second
           * argument to the highlight function to be used for getting data- attribute values
           * and using the DOM for the code-input */,

    [] // Array of plugins (see below)
  ));
  ```

### 3. Adding plugins
[Plugins](./plugins/) allow you to add extra features to a template, like [automatic indentation](plugins/indent.js) or [support for highlight.js's language autodetection](plugins/autodetect.js). To use them, just:
- Import the plugins' JS files after you have imported `code-input` and before registering the template.
- Place instances of the plugins in the array of plugins argument when registering, like this:
```html
<script src="code-input.js"></script>
<!--...-->
<script src="plugins/autodetect.js"></script>
<script src="plugins/indent.js"></script>
<!--...-->
<script>
  codeInput.registerTemplate("syntax-highlighted", 
    codeInput.templates.hljs(
      hljs, 
      [
        new codeInput.plugins.Autodetect(), 
        new codeInput.plugins.Indent(true, 2) // 2 spaces indentation
      ]
    )
  );
</script>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately placing multiple plugins of the same type in a template can currently cause errors and undefined behaviour, even if such a configuration makes logical sense. [This is issue #118](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input/issues/118) and will be fixed as soon as possible - if you'd like to help and have the time you're welcome, but it's also at the top of the maintainer's To-Do list.

To see a full list of plugins and their functions, please see [plugins/README.md](./plugins/README.md).

### 4. Using the component
Now that you have registered a template, you can use the custom `<code-input>` element in HTML. If you have more than one template registered, you need to add the template name as the `template` attribute. With the element, using the `language` attribute will add a `language-{value}` class to the `pre code` block. You can now use HTML attributes and events, as well as CSS styles, to make your element as simple or interactive as you like, as if it were a `textarea` element! 
  ```HTML
  <code-input language="HTML"></code-input>
  ```
  *or*
  ```HTML
  <code-input language="HTML" placeholder="Type code here" template="syntax-highlighted" onchange="console.log('Your code is', this.value)">&lt; href='https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input'>code-input&lt;/a></code-input>
  ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è At the moment, you need to set the `--padding` property rather than `padding` for a `code-input` element's CSS. All other properties should work as normal.
