> **An editable &lt;textarea&gt; that supports *any* syntax highlighting algorithm, for code or something else. Also, added plugins.**
> 
> Aiming to be more flexible, lightweight, modular, progressively enhanced and standards-based than the alternatives, we support HTML forms, the `<textarea>` JavaScript interface, more languages and more use cases.
