# How `code-input.js` works Behind The Scenes

> Contributors: 2021 Oliver Geer

Bearing in mind that it will teach you to make your own version of the core of <code>code-input.js</code> but you should use the library itself if you want more stability, please see [this CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-editable-textarea-that-supports-syntax-highlighted-code). It was written by the founder of the library just before development started, so doesn't contain all bugfixes but does contain the core theory and how to create a minimal `code-input` yourself.
