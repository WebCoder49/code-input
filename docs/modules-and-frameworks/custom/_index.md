# Using code-input.js with custom highlighting algorithms in projects which use modules or frameworks

> Contributors: 2025 Oliver Geer

We plan to get documentation for this soon (contributions via a pull request are welcome!), but for now please use [the corresponding article for highlight.js](../hljs) and [the demo vanilla code for code-input and custom highlighting algorithms](../../#playground-preset-custom).
