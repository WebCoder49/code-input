# Using code-input.js with Prism.js in projects which use modules or frameworks 

> Contributors: 2025 Oliver Geer

We plan to get documentation for this soon (contributions via a pull request are welcome!), but for now please use [the corresponding article for highlight.js](../hljs), and [the demo vanilla code for code-input and Prism.js](../../#playground-preset-prism). <!--Good time to add docs here would be release of Prism v2.-->

Bear in mind that the Prism.js library can be imported into ECMAScript modules as follows:
```javascript
import Prism from "prismjs";
```
