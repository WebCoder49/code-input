# `code-input` vs the `textarea` in JavaScript

> Contributors: 2025 Oliver Geer

Once registered, `code-input` elements support most of the JavaScript properties and events used with a `textarea` element, because they are built around them. Try swapping out your `textarea` element in your JavaScript application for a `code-input`! If it doesn't work, [submit a bug report](https://github.com/WebCoder49/code-input/issues).

If you want to replace a `textarea` with a `code-input` in an application that doesn't need JavaScript, [look here](../forms). We support HTML5 forms, and progressive enhancement so JavaScript isn't needed!
