# Using code-input.js with Prism.js in projects which use modules or frameworks 

> Contributors: 2025 Oliver Geer

We plan to get documentation for this soon (contributions via a pull request are welcome!), but for now please use [the corresponding article for highlight.js](../hljs) and [the demo frameworkless code for code-input and Prism.js](../../#playground-preset-prism).
