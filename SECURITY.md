# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you find a sensitive security vulnerability in the code-input.js library, please email the maintainer Oliver Geer at [security@webcoder49.dev](mailto:security@webcoder49.dev), optionally using [this encryption key](https://ogeer.org#pgp). GitHub security advisories (different to the more general "issues") are also accepted.
